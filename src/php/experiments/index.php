						<p class="txt">The Coffee Trike logo system was designed while working at under the art direction of Aaron Belyea at Alphabet Arm in the summer of 2012. Founder and owner of the Coffee Trike, Alessandro “San” Bellino is changing the coffee game in Boston by bringing the first espresso tricycle to the States. By combining his love for cycling with his passion for great coffee, he has spawned a truly unique and exciting business. In developing the logo system, I wanted to highlight the timeless modernity of San’s idea. The type treatment is stylish, understated, and references old world typography without being dated. The icon set is clean, direct, and emphasizes the two most important parts of the business. Keep up with San on Twitter @thecoffeetrike to find out when he’ll be pulling espresso in your neighborhood.</p>
